# SEO Refactor
## Description
Given files for an active website, the end goal is to refactor the files so that it is up to accessibility standards. This is also ideal for optimizing the site for search engines.

## My Process
- Checked the navigation links to make sure they work correctly.
- Worked on consolidating duplicate CSS rules by using parent class names for elements that were styled the same for each child element. 
- Added comments to the stylesheet for better readability.
- Replaced some of the divs with semantic elements to the HTML page and updated the corresponding names in the stylesheet.
- Added a title to the <head> element.
- Added alt attributes to images for better screen reader usability.
- Looked over the order and structure of HTML elements and checked the headings were in sequential order.
- As always, double checked that my work met given criteria and personal quality standards.
